                With this in mind, it is critical to thoroughly prepare yourself before embarking on a snowy adventure. Even the most professional drivers in the best-prepared vehicles may find driving on snow and ice-covered roads hazardous. Both ice and snow restrict traction, making it more difficult to begin rolling. However, if you reside in an area where the roads are frequently covered in snow and ice, keeping fully off the roadways is not a realistic alternative. It also entails lesser daylight hours and foggy weather, which makes visibility problematic. Before the snow begins to fall, you should keep in mind your car safety precautions and prepare vehicle for the season by ensuring that it is capable of handling severe winter driving conditions from now on with Be Auto Insurance guidance.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">The sides of snowy roadways are frequently cluttered with cars that should never have left their driveways due to worn-out tires. Every winter, severe weather, winter storms and poor road conditions contribute to hundreds of thousands of fatal crashes. Drivers should be aware of the car safety precautions to take in the case of a winter road emergency. It is worthwhile to learn how to prepare yourself and your vehicle.

        <!-- <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Let’s have a sneak peek at the list of top auto insurance benefits, the Best Local Auto Insurance has compiled a comprehensive.
        </p> -->
        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Be Auto Insurance have put an effort and bring you a list of winter driving tips that starts well before you hit the road, we’ve got some useful for everyone. Let's have a sneak peek of them.
        </p>
        <h3>Get Your Car Prepared</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Making sure your car is in good condition is one of the best ways to minimize the odds of arriving safely. It's a good idea to have an oil change, inspection, and tune-up before the snowfalls. It all starts with inspecting the condition of your tires and ensuring that they have enough tread to handle snow. Before starting the engine, make sure all auto wiper controls are turned off since this could blow the wiper control fuse if they are frozen on the screen, it’s an incredible winter driving tip. It's always a good idea to keep your gas tank at least half full. It's even more important to have plenty of fuel during the winter when there's a higher chance you'll get stuck in traffic. The most important car safety precaution is to make sure your tire chains, emergency kit, and ice scraper are all in your vehicle before winter comes. Most notably, your brakes need more than maintenance upkeep using them correctly on the road is crucial to retaining control on wet, icy, or snowy roads. 
          </p>
          <h3>Carry the Right Supplies</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Make sure your car has the items four your car safety: a demisting pad, a torch to wind-up so you don't run out of battery, a duvet to keep you warm, some food, a drink, spare screen wash, deicer, ice scraper, phone charger, map, a first aid kit, some jump leads and a spade that you can use to put under your drive wheels should you get trapped.
          </p>
          <h3>Drive Super Smoothly</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">The key to driving safely in the snow is to be smooth with the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes. Why? Jerky control movements quickly unstick tires with a fragile grip on the slick road, so that every turn of the wheel, push of the brakes, and movement of the accelerator must be careful, calm, and steady. Pretend you have a cup of scorching coffee in your lap and drive carefully so you don't spill it. Keep a note of that; it's a really handy winter driving tip.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Prepare For Less Light</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Even if you're used to it, driving on ice and snow may be nerve-racking, even when the skies are clear. However, as a storm hits, driving may become incredibly frightening as well as deadly. Whether you reside in a harsh winter climate or are simply passing through one. Because there is less sunshine, roadways will be congested even in complete darkness or at sunrise and sunset. As a result, there will be a lot of glare from low sunlight and headlights, so it’s necessary to keep your windscreen clean both inside and out to reduce the blinding effects.
          </p>
          <h3>Avoid Losing Traction 
          </h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">On a snowy road, how much traction do you have? Knowing what one particular small, amber, flashing light in the instrument cluster means is one way to understand before you go into danger. It's a car outline with squiggly lines behind it. If you're driving in a straight path and this light blinks, it's the stability-control system notifying you that the wheels driving the car are slipping. Make a note of it. Also, take it easy on the pedal to allow the tires to regain their grip.
          </p>
          <h3>Deal with the Skids</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">You'll hit a slippery area sooner or later and get a queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach as your automobile begins to slide away from the direction you want to be going. Skids, even big ones, are manageable, and you may quickly regain control of a vehicle. First and foremost, do not panic and do not slam the brakes! Instead, ease off the gas when the wheels start to slide and lose grip, and the car rotates in a wider arc than expected. Whatever type of skid you're in, keep your wheels pointed in the direction you want to go. 
          </p>
          <h3>Keep a Safe Distance
          </h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Other drivers who are either inexperienced on icy roads or do not have the right tires mounted are a major concern when driving in a snowfall. Take it slowly. Distance between vehicles is essential when driving in a snowfall because you need enough distance and time to safely brake a very handy winter driving tip.
            You can quickly lose traction if you slam on the brakes, so keep your speed down and let other drivers overtake you if they choose to tailgate or drive faster.
          </p>
          <h3>Stay Put & Stay Back </h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;"> If you find yourself in a dangerous scenario, keep as much distance as possible from other vehicles. This, in the combination with slowing down, is one of the most effective ways to minimize the risk of an accident. When the conditions are extremely severe, experts recommend a distance of up to six times the normal distance. Sudden movements can cause your tires to spin out and lose traction, so when driving in a snowfall, keep your movements as steady and slow as possible. </p>
          <h3>Stay Alert & Minimize Distractions </h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Keep the music down, your phone in its holder, and your eyes on the road. Make sure that you are fully focused on the road and on other drivers. Even though this is an excellent winter driving tip for all driving conditions, it is extremely vital when driving on wet, snowy, or icy roads. Keep your phone turned off or connected to Bluetooth in your car, and never take your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road to check it.</p>
          <h3>Takeaway</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Whether you're on a road trip for the holidays or traveling around town, remember to keep your vehicle, drive safely, and avoid driving if the conditions are too severe.
