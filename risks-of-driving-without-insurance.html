              <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">
                We all know auto insurance is important. It protects you as a driver, as well as others you encounter on the road. Driving without coverage could be an exceptionally costly choice.
If you cause the crash, you’ll likely be held liable for any bodily injuries and property damage. You can also expect to pay fines and may have your license suspended and vehicle impounded.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">If you’re not at fault, the law varies by state and accident. When fault is unclear, you may be responsible for handling communication with the other party’s car insurance company, which can put you in a difficult situation. It may also reduce your chances of receiving compensation if someone else was at fault. Common penalties include, Jail time, Substantial fines, Car registration and driving license suspension, Vehicle impoundment, Court fees, Points on an individual license
              </p>
              <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Getting caught without car insurance in some states is nightmarish, even if you're not the at-fault driver. If the uninsured driver was hit, they have limited rights of demanding compensation from the insured driver. Also, you may end up paying for damages and medical bills for people affected by the collision even if you're not responsible for the specific accident.

        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">You may choose to forego auto insurance in hopes of getting away with temporary savings. But you could wind up paying far more than what you save if you get caught or have an accident. Before you consider driving without insurance, we at Be Auto Insurance want to help you understand the risks and help you make wise decision. 
        </p>
        <h3>Why Is Driving Without Insurance Illegal?</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Driving without insurance is a danger to yourself and other motorists. When a simple accident occurs, it ruins the car and lives of the injured people. Compensating these individuals and paying for car repair bills without insurance can run your savings dry and may lead to the loss of your assets.
          </p>
          <p>In the U.S., the average car liability claim for bodily injuries is up to $15,000 per accident. At-fault drivers are responsible for these costs if they don't have minimum liability coverage. Moreover, lawsuits amounting to millions of dollars are possible for severe collisions. If you've been driving without auto insurance, you don't want to take this risk.</p>
          <p>In most places, drivers who own a registered vehicle must carry a certain amount of car insurance to legally get behind the wheel. Each state has its own minimum coverage requirements drivers are expected to follow. Moreover, driving without auto insurance is illegal in 48 states.
            The 48 states that mandate car insurance require personal liability insurance, including bodily injury and property damage coverage. </p>
          <h3>What are the associated costs of driving without insurance?</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Financially speaking, driving without insurance can be costly, even beyond the costs insurance would’ve paid for. If you’re unable to show proof you’re insured, the consequences vary based upon the state you’re driving in.
          </p>
          <p>Generally, if you’re pulled over without auto insurance and have no prior offenses, you’ll likely pay a fine. Your fines are state specific and can range from very nominal to several thousands of dollars. Some states may have harsher consequences, such as suspending your driver’s license and registration and requiring you to pay higher fees to reinstate them. Other states give police the right to impound your vehicle if you can’t provide proof of auto insurance, making you responsible for towing fees and other associated costs. And while it's unlikely for a first offense, you could even face jail time for driving without insurance.</p>
          <p>The real question you need to ask yourself when you're considering dropping or not carrying insurance is whether you should avoid driving until you can afford it again, or find cheaper insurance to help you stay protected.
            Determining whether you're at fault or not may be difficult at times. Inviting your insurance agents to the accident scene is instrumental in straightening the facts with your car's claims adjuster and its restoration. Without coverage, you'll end up paying for the financial responsibilities alone.</p>
          <h3>Getting Into an Accident without Insurance</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Getting into an accident without insurance is a serious offense, and you’re going to face both legal and financial repercussions. 
            If the accident was your fault, then someone is going to be expecting you to pay. If you get into an accident and you don’t have insurance, you’re going to pay a large fine, your vehicle will get towed, and you could lose your license, among other things. It’s also very likely you will end up in court, which means you should obtain legal counsel.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">If your car is destroyed, you can make a collision or comprehensive insurance claim, depending on the underlying cause. The payment for a wrecked car is equivalent to its market value at the time of the accident. That implies that if you buy a vehicle now at an increased price and it is wrecked or stolen later when vehicle values have fallen, you could be in a bad situation. You'd be owing money owe more than the value of the vehicle. An auto insurance covers the difference, saving you money. 
          </p>
          <p>After getting into an accident, your first instinct may be to purchase a car insurance policy right away. It’s a smart move, but it won’t lessen your punishment. Car insurance only protects you while the policy is active. So if you get into an accident on Monday morning and purchase a policy on Monday night, you won’t be retroactively covered. </p>

          <h3>Penalties With lapsed Auto Insurance is a traffic offense in all U.S</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Getting caught without auto insurance in some states is nightmarish, even if you're not the at-fault driver. If the uninsured driver was hit, they have limited rights of demanding compensation from the insured driver. Also, you may end up paying for damages and medical bills for people affected by the collision even if you're not responsible for the specific accident.
          </p>
          <p>Traffic officers use the state insurance database to validate your insurance information. If a motorist can't give proof of insurance, the officers issue a ticket and may at times suspend your license for a prescribed period. The state will reinstate your license once evidence of financial responsibility or an SR-22 form is provided.</p>
          <p>The state insurance database is used by traffic officials to confirm your insurance information. If a driver cannot provide evidence of insurance, authorities will issue a penalty and may suspend your license for a specified length of time. Once you provide proof of financial responsibility or an SR-22 form, the state will reinstate your license.</p>

          <h3>Imprisonment</h3>
          <p>First-time offenders who drive without having insurance are not sentenced to prison unless the accident is severe. Repeat offenders face steep penalties and up to 180 days in jail. Driving without insurance in Michigan can result in a year in jail. Impoundment of your Car.</p>
